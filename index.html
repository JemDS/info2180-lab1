		<p>Hi! I am a Software Engineering Student at the University Of the West Indies, Mona campus.I enjoy listening to music and cooking.
		<p>Today's society is continuously evolving, as such people have begun conducting many of their daily tasks using various software and online platforms. Therefore in a effort to stay in the loop and to garnier the necessary skills, I have decided to enroll in this Web development course. I personally think this course is quite interesting and  will allow me to learn the ins and out of key web development concepts.</p>
		<p>Looking forward to a fun and informative semester!</p>
